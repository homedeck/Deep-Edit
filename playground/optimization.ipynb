    "# Deep End-to-End Photo Editing\n",
    "We're taking a different approach from before: we want to design a pipeline that can be trained end-to-end on photo ediitng. We have a fixed forward model, the Lightroom model, and we need to learn a set of ediitng heuristics from a user-provided set of before-after pairs."

    "We begin with a set of pristine images $X$ and edited images $Y$, from which we build image pairs $(x, y), x \\in X, y \\in Y$. We seek a transformation $f(\\cdot): X \\mapsto Y$ which minimizes the *difference* between each $x$ and $y$. This objective function $g(\\cdot): X \\times Y \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}$ is a pseudosemimetric of image perceptual similarity. Choices include:\n",
